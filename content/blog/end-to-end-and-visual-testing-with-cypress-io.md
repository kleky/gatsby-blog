title: End-to-end and Visual Testing with Cypress.io
---
So, you're a small team building a large app, what's your testing approach? Do you invest a lot of time writing unit tests for all of your components in addition to the business logic? Do you do TDD, only to have to spend more time changing all of your tests when the implementation invariably changes? All of this sucks up a huge amount of time, so I'd like to present an approach that can give you the test coverable you need without the huge overhead and this comes in the form of end-to-end tests using [Cypress.io](https://cypress.io).
